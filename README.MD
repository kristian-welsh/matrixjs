This is a simple 3d rendderer that i built first in actionscript 3 to test my konwledge of the rendering process.
In this repo, I am porting it into javascript to submit it as part of a university assessment.
This repo is public for others to allow people to learn from it, but i do not expect pull requests, and i am not releasing any rights other than those implicitly released by uploading it to github.
